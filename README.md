# Azeez Daoud - Task 15

# Techniques used in Kattis Assignments
## Guess Structure
By reading data use the operations to push and pop into the different structures and comparing it with the given data.
At the end determine what is the data representing.
This might be a very bruteforcey approach to this problem, but it works. I also used the C++ Standard Library Containers.

## Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree: RED BLACK TREE
The node code an the tree is under `RBTree/tree.hpp`. Unit tests are under `RBTree/main.cpp`

To run the code use the `g++` compiler while inside the `RBTree` directory, type if you are on Windows:
```
g++ main.cpp & a.exe
```

If you are using Linux, then you know how to compile and run a good ol' C++ file.
